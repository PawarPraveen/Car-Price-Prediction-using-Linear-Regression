#  Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

##  Overview
This project predicts the selling price of cars based on features such as mileage, age, and engine size. It demonstrates data preprocessing,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and linear regression modeling with clear visualizations.

##  Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values & irrelevant columns.
- **EDA**: Visualize relationships between features and target.
- **Model Training**: Linear Regression using scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation**: R² score, residual analysis, and prediction plots.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
